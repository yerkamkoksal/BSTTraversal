# Phonebook Management using BST and AVL Trees

## Description
This project is a phonebook management system that utilizes Binary Search Trees (BST) and AVL Trees for efficient data storage and retrieval. It allows for operations like searching, adding, and deleting contacts. The system also features printing the phonebook in both in-order and pre-order to files and drawing the tree structure of the phonebook.

## Features
- Load contacts from a file to both BST and AVL Trees.
- Search for contacts by full name.
- Add new contacts.
- Delete existing contacts.
- Print the phonebook to a file (both in in-order and pre-order).
- Draw the tree structure of the phonebook to a file.

## Usage
1. **Compile the Program**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler.
2. **Run the Executable**: Follow the prompts to perform various operations:
   - Search for a contact.
   - Add a new contact.
   - Delete a contact.
   - Print the phonebook.
   - Draw the phonebook as a tree.

### Example Usage
Choose which action to perform from 1 to 6:
1 - Search a phonebook contact
2 - Adding a phonebook contact
3 - Deleting a phonebook contact
4 - Print the phonebook to a file (inorder and preorder)
5 - Draw the phonebook as a Tree to a file
6 - Exit


## Installation
No additional libraries are required for this project. It uses standard C++ libraries and headers.

## Note
- Ensure the input file for contacts is in the correct format.
- The program measures the performance in terms of time taken for various operations, providing insights into the efficiency of BSTs and AVL Trees.
